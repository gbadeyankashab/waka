    <h2 class="title text-primary">FAQs</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> What are EMD Vouchers:</li>
        <p>EMD vouchers are Electronic Miscellaneous Document issued via the airline with the same value of an original ticket paid to the airline which can be used by same passengers to purchase another ticket with same airline for a future date.</p>
        <p>The vouchers are usually valued for one year or based on the initial validity of your original ticket and can be used to buy a new ticket on any future travel date.</p>
        <li>What are Open Tickets:</li>
        <p>Most airlines have allowed passengers to leave tickets open allowing the customer to make a change in the future. Not all airlines allow one free change on your flight ticket, which gives customers time to decide after the pandemic to utilize the flight ticket.</p>
        <li> Status on Refunds:</li>
        <p>A recent open letter by International Air Transport Association (IATA) on refunds by the airline states that; “Our industry is experiencing a critical liquidity crisis. Most airlines are spending more cash in reimbursing their passengers than they receive in new booking revenues. We recently estimated the industry’s liability in this area at $35 billion. In this context, airlines’ most urgent need is to keep their remaining liquidity to pay salaries and face their fixed 2 costs. It is practically impossible for industry players to find sufficient financial means to keep the air travel value chain operating in the short time that airlines have before facing bankruptcy.”</p>
        <p>We have seen delays in refunds process from the airline which we can no longer determine when the funds will be paid to the company to reimburse our customers, hence we have been advised to offer customers EMD vouchers or leave the tickets open for a future travel</p>
